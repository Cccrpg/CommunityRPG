# Critters, Caverns, and Catacombs

**An RPG full of Creative Commons and Crunch**

## Objectives

This is similar, in some ways, to the Old School Renaissance games. I'm trying to capture back some of the things that I enjoyed in a role-playing game.

In this case, I fully admit to liking my RPG crunch. For those familiar with the GSN Theory, I'm very much into Game-ism. I like fiddling with numbers, making 20 versions of a character with the same set of dice rolls, and figuring out how to make that overpowered magic item that is technically within the rules even if it breaks the game.

I actually believe that my path down this road started before some of the more popular role-playing games that supported game-ism existed. Back during the era being recreated by the old school Renaissance group, I had several discussion with a friend about how I wasn't completely happy with the role-playing game that I was most familiar with and felt like I knew enough I could make my own.

He challenged me to begin, and I started flushing something out, but never felt confident enough to share it. Since then I've learned a bit more and I think I might be able to actually produce something that others who are also into game-ism and crunchy RPGs would enjoy.

## Goals

I'm trying to meet needs of a few different audiences, which means that I have to be expressive in the way that I create these rules.

One audience I'm trying to reach is people trying to pick up a simple game at home, with either family or friends. This would be the group that might be playing some other role and move game that we are all familiar with. I actually think that this audience is easier to reach if the rules are designed with the idea of game-ism. These people want to be able to pick up a game board, read through a rule book, and be able to have some fun while learning a new game while also socializing, using dice they can pick up at a grocery store. What they don't want are polyhedral dice and tons of options before you even begin to play. This means that I'm going to want a few easy and starting dungeons that can be played with either tokens or miniatures, I'm going to want rules that rely upon cubic only dice, and I'm going to want pre-generated characters ready to go.

Another audience I'm hoping to be able to please is the metagamer. The person who wants to understand how all the rules work inside and out so they can extend, change, or make their own. These people buy a game system knowing that they're going to change the rules around to suit what they want to do. That they're going to play the game in ways beyond where it was tested, and clearly see how changes they make will alter the way it is played. What they want is a detailed rule book, lots of rules, and polyhedral dice. What they don't want is cubic dice and no options. This means that I'm going to want designer notes, alternative rules, and plenty of options.

The final audience I'm hoping to please is the crunchy gamer, which is really myself. I want to be able to go into a game and know that we've agreed upon the rules before we start. That I can design a magic item and have an idea of what it's market value will be. That I will be getting into the minutia of how the universe works so the players can win. These people don't care which type of dice or how easy it is to get started, because that is just the beginning.

## Methodology

One thing I've noticed, at least with my gaming groups, is that more and more people rely upon tablets, phones, and other personal electronic devices while playing. So my plan is that the primary method of delivery will be an `epub`, and since gaming needs vary, we'll need to have a few different options when dividing up the `epub`.

I have personally enjoyed some of the reading from the works of the [standard ebooks project](https://standardebooks.org), and have even played around with their tools which keep the editorial and typeographic standards in a published ebook very high. So my plan is to have xhtml files ready to filter and drop into an standard ebook before using the standard ebook tool set to generate an `epub` file.

My eventual hope is that most people could download the source files, decide what sections they want, ask for a build, and then push their `epub` file onto their device. A player could include just the things required for their character, or a game moderator could have an overly inclusive version with every potential rule in one massive `epub` file alongside all the designer notes and alternative available.

## Getting Started

The best way for you to get started is really to download a recent release, grab some friends, and try playing it. Before you try becoming any more involved, you should really understand how the current system works. The best part is, you don't even have to build it. Just go grab some `epub` files and start playing.

## Getting Involved

The simplest way to get involved would be to clone this repository, add in some things, and put in a pull request. Got an idea how to improve the campaign world? Put it in and make a pull request. I make no guarantees about which pull requests I will accept and which I will not, but I will state my core ideas here.

## The Core Ideas

- Fantastic. There is magic and it is everywhere. Wizards roam the world and creatures have supernatural abilities. Magic permeates everything.
- Ancient. There are the remains of old, and fallen, empires. Ancient scripts, old coins, and dangers to face before you can get them. Forgotten lore and powerful dangers to avoid.
- Systems. This is a collection of systems. Systems can be scaled to the needs of their users. Rules indicate misunderstood systems.

### Example

Take for instance my model of elements. There are eight of them.
- It is fantastic because this is also how spells are divided. Spells fall into eight categories that align with the elements. Creatures have attacks that align with the elements, planar travel allows you to visit all eight elements.
- It's ancient because these elemental realms have ancient empires, a diversity of languages, and are the sources of some mostly forgotten scripts.
- It's a system because the eight elements come from a combination of three properties. Earth is blunt, heavy, and immobile but Fire is sharp, light, and mobile; and each of the eight elements are a combination of those properties.

Being able to explain, even in the designer's text, how these ideas are met will probably make it more likely that I will accept your pull request.

I'm much more likely to accept a system than a rule. Sending in a change about magic candles is likely to be ignored, but sending in a change about how magic candles are a way to cast area effect spells which are activated by use along with updated random treasure tables is likely to be accepted (unless I get to that part myself).

## The Road Forward

My first goal is just to gather all the ideas I have in old notebooks, electronic notes, and ideas floating about in my head into github. Make a couple of usable `epub` files, try it out with my group, and hope for good feedback.

After that I want to make some scripts so I can make a source pool of `xhtml` files and generate the `epub` files.

Then it should be a cycle of design, expand, and re-release.
